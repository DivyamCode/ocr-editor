The primary function of a program is to get executed. So it must be written following the rules
described above.

However, a program should also be written so that it is easy to understand, when programmers
read it. The reason is simple. One programmer may write a program, which another programmer
may need to modify. In such cases the second programmer must be able to understand why the
program was written in the manner it was written. This process can be aided if the original pro-
grammer writes additional notes to explain the tricky ideas in the program. For this purpose, C++
allows you to insert comments in your program. A comment is text that is not meant to be executed,
but is meant solely for humans who might read the program.

A comment can be written in two ways. At any point on a line, you may place two slash
characters, //, and then the text following the // to the end of the line becomes a comment.
Alternatively, anything following the /* characters becomes a comment, and this comment can span
over several lines, ending only with the appearance of the characters */.

It is customary to put comments at the beginning mentioning the author of the program and
stating what the program does. Subsequently, wherever something non-obvious is being done in the
program, it is considered polite to explain using a comment.

Here is our polygon drawing program written the way it should be written.

#include <simplecpp>

/* Program to draw a regular polygon with as many sides as the user wants.
Author: Abhiram Ranade
Date: 18 Feb 2013.

*/

main_program{
int nsides;
cout << "Type in the number of sides: ";
cin >> nsides;

turtleSim() ;

repeat (nsides){

forward(50) ; // Each side will have length 50 pixels.

left (360.0/nsides); // Because sum(exterior angles of a polygon) = 360.

wait (5);

7 Computation without graphics

Although we began this introduction with a picture drawing program, every program you write
need not contain any drawing. Here is a program that does not draw anything, but merely reads a
number from the keyboard, and prints out its cube.

main_program{

int n;
cout <<"Type the number you want cubed: ";
